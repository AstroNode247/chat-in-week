       " 'answer': '**How to sell a service**\\n\\n1. **Tell people in a single sentence why they should buy from you.**\\n\\nYour value proposition should be clear and concise, and it should highlight what makes your service unique and valuable. For example, \"We help businesses grow their revenue by 20% in 6 months.\"\\n\\n2. **Advertise.**\\n\\nGet the word out about your service through advertising. This could include online advertising, print advertising, or even word-of-mouth marketing.\\n\\n3. **Make your service easy to order or buy.**\\n\\nMake it easy for potential customers to do business with you. This means having a clear and simple ordering process, and making it easy to pay for your service.\\n\\n4. **Talk about the other person, not yourself.**\\n\\nWhen you\\'re selling a service, it\\'s important to focus on the needs of the customer. Talk about how your service can help them achieve their goals, and avoid talking about yourself or your company too much.\\n\\n5. **Show that you care passionately about your clients’ business.**\\n\\nCustomers want to know that you\\'re invested in their success. Show them that you care about their business by going the extra mile, and by being responsive to their needs.\\n\\n6. **Write a mission statement and keep it private.**\\n\\nA mission statement is a statement of your company\\'s purpose. It should be clear, concise, and inspiring. Keep your mission statement private, so that you can focus on your customers\\' needs, rather than on your own company\\'s goals.\\n\\n7. **Draw a clear map. After every mission statement, add an objectives statement.**\\n\\nAn objectives statement is a statement of how you plan to achieve your mission. It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\\n\\n8. **If the mission statement doesn’t inspire people to act, change it.**\\n\\nYour mission statement should inspire your team to action. If it doesn\\'t, then it\\'s not a good mission statement. Change it until it does.\\n\\n9. **Prove your service quality. Be honest. Tricks and gimmicks are not the key.**\\n\\nThe best way to prove your service quality is to be honest and upfront about what you can and cannot do. Don\\'t make promises that you can\\'t keep, and don\\'t try to trick or gimmick your customers.\\n\\n10. **If you think your promotional idea is silly or unprofessional, it is.**\\n\\nYour promotional ideas should be professional and respectful of your customers. If you think an idea is silly or unprofessional, then it probably is. Don\\'t use it.\\n\\n11. **Prospects buy how good you are at who you are.**\\n\\nCustomers want to buy from people they like and trust. Be yourself, and let your personality shine through in your sales pitch.\\n\\n12. **Convey that you are positively good. Do not try to say you are the best or superior.**\\n\\nCustomers are more likely to be turned off by a sales pitch that is too aggressive or boastful. Instead, focus on conveying that you are positively good at what you do.\\n\\n13. **People like to feel you are comfortable like a pair of old slippers.**\\n\\nCustomers want to feel comfortable doing business with you. Be friendly, approachable, and easy to talk to.\\n\\n14. **It is always better to say too little than too much.**\\n\\nWhen it comes to sales, it\\'s always better to say too little than too much. Leave your customers wanting more, and they\\'ll be more likely to come back for more.'}"
