       " 'answer': '**How to sell a service**\\n\\n1. **Tell people in a single sentence why they should buy from you.**\\n\\nYour value proposition should be clear and concise, and it should highlight what makes your service unique and valuable. For example, \"We provide the highest quality customer service in the industry.\"\\n\\n2. **Advertise.**\\n\\nGet the word out about your service through advertising. This can be done through online channels, such as social media and search engine marketing, as well as offline channels, such as print advertising and billboards.\\n\\n3. **Make your service easy to order or buy.**\\n\\nMake it easy for potential customers to do business with you. This means having a clear and simple ordering process, and making it easy to pay for your service.\\n\\n4. **Talk about the other person, not yourself.**\\n\\nWhen you\\'re selling a service, it\\'s important to focus on the needs of the customer. Talk about how your service can help them achieve their goals, and avoid talking about yourself or your company too much.\\n\\n5. **Show that you care passionately about your clients’ business.**\\n\\nCustomers want to know that you\\'re invested in their success. Show them that you care about their business by going the extra mile, and by being responsive to their needs.\\n\\n6. **Write a mission statement and keep it private.**\\n\\nA mission statement is a statement of your company\\'s purpose. It should be clear, concise, and inspiring. Keep your mission statement private, so that you can focus on achieving your goals without being distracted by outside influences.\\n\\n7. **Draw a clear map. After every mission statement, add an objectives statement.**\\n\\nAn objectives statement is a statement of what you need to do to achieve your mission. It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\\n\\n8. **If the mission statement doesn’t inspire people to act, change it.**\\n\\nYour mission statement should inspire you and your team to take action. If it doesn\\'t, then it\\'s not effective. Change it until it does.\\n\\n9. **Prove your service quality. Be honest. Tricks and gimmicks are not the key.**\\n\\nCustomers want to know that they can trust you. Prove your service quality by being honest and transparent. Avoid using tricks and gimmicks to sell your service.\\n\\n10. **If you think your promotional idea is silly or unprofessional, it is.**\\n\\nYour promotional ideas should be professional and respectful. If you think an idea is silly or unprofessional, then it probably is. Don\\'t use it.\\n\\n11. **Prospects buy how good you are at who you are.**\\n\\nCustomers want to do business with people they like and trust. Be yourself, and let your personality shine through.\\n\\n12. **Convey that you are positively good. Do not try to say you are the best or superior.**\\n\\nCustomers are more likely to be attracted to a service that is positively good, rather than one that is the best or superior. Avoid using superlatives, and focus on highlighting the positive aspects of your service.\\n\\n13. **People like to feel you are comfortable like a pair of old slippers.**\\n\\nCustomers want to feel comfortable doing business with you. Be approachable and easy to talk to.\\n\\n14. **It is always better to say too little than too much.**\\n\\nWhen it comes to selling a service, it\\'s always better to say too little than too much. Avoid overwhelming potential customers with information.\\n\\n15. **If you fail to communicate your message clearly, it will cost you.**\\n\\nYour marketing message should be clear and concise. If you fail to communicate your message clearly, it will cost you customers.\\n\\n16. **Service is the heart of service marketing, but marketing is the brains. If the brain fails, the heart follows.**\\n\\nMarketing is essential for selling a service. It\\'s the brains of your business. If you fail to market your service effectively, it will fail.\\n\\n17. **Don’t just think better. Think different.**\\n\\nTo be successful in selling a service, you need to think differently. Don\\'t just do what everyone else is doing. Find a unique way to market your service, and stand out from the competition.'}"
