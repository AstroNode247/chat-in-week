       " 'answer': '**How to sell a service**\\n\\n1. **Tell people in a single sentence why they should buy from you.**\\n\\nThis is your value proposition. It should be clear, concise, and persuasive. For example, \"We help businesses grow their revenue by 20%.\"\\n\\n2. **Advertise.**\\n\\nGet the word out about your service through advertising. This could include online advertising, print advertising, or social media marketing.\\n\\n3. **Make your service easy to order or buy.**\\n\\nMake it easy for potential customers to do business with you. This means having a clear and simple ordering process, and making it easy to pay for your service.\\n\\n4. **Talk about the other person, not yourself.**\\n\\nWhen you\\'re selling a service, it\\'s important to focus on the customer\\'s needs and wants. Talk about how your service can help them achieve their goals, and avoid talking about yourself or your company too much.\\n\\n5. **Show that you care passionately about your clients’ business.**\\n\\nCustomers want to know that you\\'re invested in their success. Show them that you care by going the extra mile, and by being responsive to their needs.\\n\\n6. **Write a mission statement and keep it private.**\\n\\nA mission statement is a statement of your company\\'s purpose. It should be inspiring and motivating, and it should guide your decision-making. Keep your mission statement private, so that you can focus on your customers\\' needs, rather than on your own internal goals.\\n\\n7. **Draw a clear map. After every mission statement, add an objectives statement.**\\n\\nAn objectives statement is a statement of what you want to achieve. It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. After you write a mission statement, add an objectives statement to help you stay on track.\\n\\n8. **If the mission statement doesn’t inspire people to act, change it.**\\n\\nYour mission statement should inspire you and your team to take action. If it doesn\\'t, change it until it does.\\n\\nBy following these tips, you can increase your chances of selling your service and growing your business.'}"
