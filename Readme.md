# Chatbot for local machine 
You don't need to have an internet connection to chat with a chatbot. Also, you don't need to have a powerful PC to run the model within you're local machine. 

The least you must have are :
* python 3.11
* openhermes-.2.5-mistral-7b GGUF version which you can download on hugging face. Create a folder named **llm_model** and put the model there
* Create your python environment and run ```pip install requirements.txt``` to install all packages
* Finally, enjoy with ```python chat.py```
